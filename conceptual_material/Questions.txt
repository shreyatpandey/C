Q] How can we send data when its pointer? Is it good idea to send a pointer to another computer or server at first place?
Ans:- A pointer is a local (as in the same PC) variable that holds the address of some object in the process' own memory space. 
It doesn't even make sense to other processes inside the same machine, so there is no point in being able to send it to another computer.

If you just want to know whether it is possible to send the pointer to other computers, indeed it is possible, but as I wrote before, it wouldn't make any sense. 
(It is possible, because the address is just a number)
